This repository is used to back up the answers about faith that have been deleted on Zhihu, and to ensure that the links cited in my own articles are valid for the following reasons (Both the answers and articles are in Chinese):

1\. The answers about faith on Zhihu is often deleted due to some reasons.

2\. Other people's repository directories change, and references become invalid.

The deleted answers are in two .docx files in this project, which contain the original text and the author's reply under the corresponding answer.
